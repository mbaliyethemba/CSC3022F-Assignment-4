Instructions: 
1. Type 'make' in terminal
2. Type 'clusterer <dataset> [-o output] [-k n] [-bin b]'
	a. [-o output]: This is the name of the file that your program will write to. If no output file is supplied, the program should default to writing the final clusterings to std:cout
	b. [-k n]: This is the number of clusters to be generated by the K-means algorithm. It should default to 10.
